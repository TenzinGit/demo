within our original 3D grid,\n","we're now only considering those voxels that fall in our 39 regions of interest provided by the MSDL atlas and aggregating across voxels within those ROIS.\n","This reduces each 3D volume from a dimensionality of (50, 59, 50) to just 39,\n","for our 39 provided ROIs.\n","\n","You'll also see that the \"dimensions flipped;\"\n","that is, that we've transposed the matrix such that time is now the first rather than second dimension.\n","This follows the scikit-learn convention that rows in a data matrix are _samples_,\n","and columns in a data matrix are _features_.\n","\n","```{figure} ../images/samples-features.png\n","---\n","height: 250px\n","name: samples-features\n","---\n","The scikit-learn conventions for feature and target matrices.\n","From
